Future Goals:-
<div color="text-blue mb-2">
We are trying to integrate with python(suggestions are always welcome)text-to-speech, as 
the plugin used is IBM Watson which poses a challenge as it is not able to pick up and understand
the accent we use for speaking.

As this is only a social service application, which answers the users basic queries about
novel corona virus and keeps the user updated about the pandemic situation. We are now focusing
on the different areas of application of AR incorporated with AI/ML.</div>

For education part:
<div color="text-blue mb-2">
It can serve as the go-to spot for children's educational needs in these hours of crisis.
With numerous subjects to choose from, it serves the demand of continuous learning and education.</div>

For business part:
